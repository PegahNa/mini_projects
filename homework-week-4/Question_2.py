Question 2 of Homework 4 is there to test some of your theory.
If when first looking at questions such as these you stuggle to find
the answer, please make sure you find a reliable online resource, or 
have some suitable and efficient notes on hand should such a question
arise in the assessment.

# 2.1 What is hashing?
'''
    There are a few points you can make here. Obfuscation, calculating 
    a value from another and such. However, the main thing you'll be 
    expected to mention is that the process uses a 'Function to map
    data to a value'.

# 2.2 What are the 3 functions a hash table has to support?
'''
    This is a super logical question, don't over think it.
    A Hash Table needs to be able to have things added to it,
    removed from it, and read from it.
    Therefore:
    INSERT / GET / DELETE

# 2.3 What is it called when a value maps to an already occupied index?
'''
    For this you'll be ok to describe it a few ways, but most commonly
    we used Hash Collision within the course.
    Hash Conflict, Hash Clash, and others are also possibly acceptable.
'''

# 2.4 What are 2 ways to deal with the issue described in Question 3?
'''
    (This is referring to 2.3, not actual Q3)
    As such, this is a question that encourages your own research! We 
    only mentioned that most commonly Linked Lists are used to handle
    Hash Collision. However, through a little Googling, you'll most likely
    find multiple solutions; Open Addressing, Next Available Slot...
